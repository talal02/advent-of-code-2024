# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This repository contains my solutions to the daily programming challenges provided by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024), a fun and festive way to sharpen coding skills throughout December.

## About Advent of Code 🧩

Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual set of programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle presents a unique challenge designed to test problem-solving skills and foster creativity. This is a great opportunity to learn, improve, and share coding practices within a global community.

## Structure of the Repository 📂

This repository is organized to facilitate easy navigation and exploration of my solutions:

```
advent-of-code-2024/
│
├── day01/
│   ├── part1.py
│   └── part2.py
├── inputs/
│   ├── day01.txt
│   ├── day02.txt
│   └── ...
├── LICENSE
├── .gitignore
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

### Folder Breakdown:

-   **`dayXX/`**: Each day’s challenge will have its own folder containing solutions for both parts of the problem (`part1.py` and `part2.py`).
-   **`inputs/`**: Raw input files for each day’s challenge.
-   **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies (if any).
